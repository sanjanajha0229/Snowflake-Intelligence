name: PROCUREMENT_SEMANTIC_VIEW
description: |-
  This semantic view provides a unified and business-friendly representation of the procurement domain by integrating supplier, vendor, material, certification, and performance data. It brings together core master datasets—including global suppliers, raw materials, certifications, and vendor mappings—along with relationship tables that link suppliers to materials and certifications.

  The view enables consistent reporting and analytics by standardizing key procurement entities such as suppliers, materials, certifications, and vendor performance scores. It supports use cases like supplier qualification, sourcing decisions, cost optimization, risk assessment, and performance management.

  By combining operational procurement datasets into a single semantic layer, this view allows business users to easily explore suppliers, their materials, their compliance certifications, and their historical performance—without needing to understand the underlying data structures.
